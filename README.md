# Svelte / Express / SPA â€“ Template

Run `npm install` from a project directory.

This setup uses the [svelte-spa-router](https://github.com/ItalyPaleAle/svelte-spa-router) for client side **hash-based routing**.

You will also need [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) to monitor the express server for changes.
